I'm Logan Nelson, a new Data Scientist based in Utah, USA. I'm passionate about practical applications of machine learning, AI, and data visualization and have experience with Python, SQL, R, Minitab and more. I've been working in statistical based problem solving for 10 years as a Process Engineer, but now I'm interested in making the switch to full time Data Science. I'm axious to learn new skills and tools while applying what I know from years of data analysis.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on code to automate statistical analysis of any simple dataset and fantasy football analysis for fun.
-   For example, I'm developing a tool that can quickly and clearly identify important information in a dataset.
-   It will highlight outliers, spot key correlations, and provide valuable insights that help users make data-driven decisions.
-   My goal is to make data analysis more accessible and efficient for individuals and organizations, even if they don't have a deep background in statistics.
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to combine machine learning algorithims like linear regression, logistical regression, random forest models, and deep neural netowrks.
-   My goal is to find innovative ways AI can be implemented to benefit both companies and individuals.
-   I'm particularly excited about the potential of AI in areas like natural language processing and data analysis.
-   For instance, I'm intrigued by the idea of creating AI-powered tools that are specialized in working with numerical data, similar to ChatGPT but tailored for numeric insights.
-   I believe such tools could revolutionize decision-making processes by providing actionable numerical insights, just as ChatGPT has transformed natural language interactions.
- 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on practical AI applications. I believe it has a ton of promise, but has to be carefully implemented and used by informed customers.
-   NLP: I'm interested in working on projects that leverage NLP techniques to solve real-world problems. Whether it's building chatbots, sentiment analysis tools, language translation applications, or any other NLP-related endeavor, I'm eager to contribute my skills.
-   AI in Gaming: Gaming has always been a passion of mine, and I see tremendous potential for AI-driven improvements in the gaming experience. I'm open to collaborating on game AI projects, whether it's enhancing non-player character behavior, creating procedurally generated game content, or exploring novel approaches to game design through AI.
- 
- ðŸ¤” I'm always open to learning and growing as a developer. If you have any feedback, suggestions, or opportunities for collaboration, feel free to reach out. I believe in the power of continuous improvement and knowledge sharing.
